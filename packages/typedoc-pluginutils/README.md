# typedoc-plugin-pages

> A TypeDoc plugin that lets you integrate your own pages into the documentation output

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/typedoc-plugin-pages?color=brightgreen)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc-plugin-pages)

This plugin is based on [typedoc-plugin-loopingz-pages](https://github.com/loopingz/typedoc-plugin-loopingz-pages), which is in turn a fork of [typedoc-plugin-pages](https://github.com/mipatterson/typedoc-plugin-pages). Integrating it in this monorepo should (I hope) make easier maintainance.

## Compatibility

This plugin version should match TypeDoc `major.minor.x` for compatibility.

## Features

- 🔍 Search integration
- 🔗 Interpage hyperlinks
- 🎨 Integrated Theme
- 📑 Reflection Navigation Title Customization
- ✏️ Integrated spell-checking (coming soon...)
